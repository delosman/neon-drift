/**
 * ============================================================================
 *  Keyboard + gamepad + on-screen touch input.
 * ============================================================================
 *  Every consumer in the game reads `state` once per frame, so the edge flags
 *  (`driftPressed`, `itemPressed`, `pausePressed`, `anyPressed`) are computed
 *  here in `update()` and are true for exactly one frame. `lookBack` is a held
 *  boolean — the camera rig wants it sustained, not pulsed.
 *
 *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  THE LATENCY BUDGET (round 11) — the reason most of this file looks the way
 *  it does. `Input` is the second system in main.ts's update list and `Race` is
 *  the seventh, so a press observed here reaches `Kart.step` on the same frame.
 *  Everything between the two is therefore *chosen* lag, and it was being spent
 *  twice:
 *
 *    - `Kart` already owns a steering rack. `steerInput` chases the command
 *      through `approach(..., rate * dt)` at 8.5 units/s low speed falling to
 *      4.2 at top speed, and `steerAngle` then chases *that* at 26/s. Those are
 *      the physical rate limits, they are speed-aware, and they belong in the
 *      physics.
 *    - This file then put a SECOND rate limit in front of them: a 6.4/s ramp
 *      for keys (156 ms to full lock) and a `dt * 24` exponential lag for the
 *      touch stick and the gamepad. Two rate limiters in series is how steering
 *      gets described as "mushy". Measured lock-to-lock on the keyboard was
 *      215 ms *before physics had seen anything*.
 *
 *  So: the analogue sources (touch stick, gamepad stick) are now passed through
 *  UNFILTERED. A thumb on glass and a stick in a hand are already absolute
 *  positions — they ARE the rack command — and the kart's own rack turns them
 *  into a physical angle. The digital ramp survives only for keys and the
 *  d-pad, where an axis genuinely has to be invented, and runs at 15/s: fast
 *  enough that `Kart`'s rack is once again the single authority on how quickly
 *  a kart can turn, which is where that decision should have been all along.
 *
 *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  FRAME-RATE INDEPENDENCE. Every rate in this file is a LINEAR ramp integrated
 *  as `rate * dt`, which is exact at any step size — 30, 60 and 120 fps produce
 *  the same steering trajectory in wall-clock terms, and the bench confirms it.
 *  The old analogue path used `x += (target - x) * min(1, dt * 24)`, which is a
 *  first-order approximation of an exponential and is *not* step-invariant: it
 *  measured 66.7 ms to 0.9 at 30 fps against 91.7 ms at 120 fps, and became a
 *  hard snap below 24 fps where the factor clamps to 1. A phone that drops to
 *  30 fps must not quietly get quicker steering than the same phone at 120 Hz.
 *  There is no exponential smoother left in this file for that reason.
 *
 *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  BUFFERING. Two different problems, two different mechanisms:
 *
 *   1. *Presses that were never observed.* Keys have been latched for a while
 *      (see `latched`). Touch buttons were not, and were polled — a stab at the
 *      item button lasting less than one frame set and cleared a pointer id
 *      between two rAFs and was gone. `TouchControls` now latches too.
 *
 *   2. *Presses that arrived a frame before they were legal.* Standard in the
 *      genre and worth ~100 ms. `drift` gets a minimum hold, so a tap is still
 *      held while `Kart`'s rack winds the steering past the 0.2 it needs to
 *      commit to a slide — pressing drift and flicking the stick on the same
 *      frame used to lose the drift. `item` gets a re-arm: the press is
 *      re-offered each frame until the held-item view changes (which is the
 *      only observable proof `IItems.use` accepted it) or the window runs out,
 *      so a shot fired while the roulette is still settling still goes.
